# Shoeshop Return Prediction Model

This repository contains the machine learning model for predicting whether an item sold by a shoeshop will be returned. The model is built using a dataset of transactions stored in `transactions.parquet`.

## Dataset

The dataset `transactions.parquet` includes various features extracted from the transaction records of a shoeshop. It is structured in a way that each row represents a unique transaction, and each column represents a feature that could be related to the likelihood of an item being returned.
